# libclangsharp [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/qlyj5sxrd48wht8x/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/SerfzDvid/libclangsharp/branch/master)

Small set of C# OO bindings for libclang. Currently only contains stuff that I needed.

Libclang 3.8.0 x86 and x64 are contained in the assembly and extracted on demand in the module initializer.
